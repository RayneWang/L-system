# L-system
This L-system is based off of [Brenden Morales' L-system](https://github.com/Brenden-Morales/Three.js-L-systems).

This updated L-system includes: 
- cylinder branches (with texture mapping)
- ellipse leaves 
- color stack (for leaves)
- rotation in X and Z axis (so trees are 3D with depth)
- interpreter that defines a simple set of rules (can be added on) and allows the user to define new set of rules using the existing rules
- one symbol can be mapped to multiple rules with different probabilities
